1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd "Employee Directory Web Interface"
   ```

2. **Compile the application**
   ```bash
   # Using direct Java compilation (recommended)
   javac -cp "lib\*" -d target\classes src\main\java\com\example\App.java
   
   # Alternative: Using Maven wrapper (if available)
   .\mvnw.cmd compile
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Execute the main application
   java -cp "target\classes;lib\*" com.example.App
   ```

4. **View the output**
   - The application generates `updated_output.html` in the project root
   - Open this file in any modern web browser
   - All static resources (CSS, JS) are referenced correctly

## 🎯 How to Use

### Basic Operations

1. **Viewing Employees**: The main dashboard displays all employees in a grid layout
2. **Adding Employees**: Click "Add Employee" to open the modal form
3. **Editing Employees**: Click "Edit" on any employee card to modify details
4. **Deleting Employees**: Click "Delete" to remove an employee (with confirmation)

### Advanced Features

1. **Search**: Use the search bar to find employees by name or email
2. **Filtering**: Click "Filter" to open the sidebar and filter by department, role, or name
3. **Sorting**: Use the sort dropdown to order employees by various criteria
4. **Pagination**: Navigate through pages when displaying large datasets
5. **Responsive Design**: Access the application on any device size

### Form Validation

- **Real-time validation**: Fields are validated as you type
- **Email validation**: Ensures proper email format
- **Required fields**: All mandatory fields must be completed
- **Error messages**: Clear, helpful error messages guide users

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with breakpoints at:
- **Desktop**: 1200px+ (full layout with sidebar)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1199px (adapted layout)
- **Mobile**: <768px (stacked layout with mobile-optimized controls)

## 🎨 Features Showcase

### Employee Management

## 🔍 Code Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Class-based JavaScript**: `EmployeeDirectory` class manages all functionality
- **Event-driven design**: Centralized event handling in `bindEvents()`
- **Modular CSS**: Organized styles with clear component separation
- **Template-based rendering**: Dynamic HTML generation for employee cards

### Backend Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Template Processing**: FreeMarker for dynamic HTML generation
- **Resource Management**: Organized static asset handling

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

### 1. Maven Wrapper Issues
**Challenge**: The Maven wrapper (`mvnw.cmd`) had configuration issues preventing proper compilation.

**Solution**: Implemented direct Java compilation approach using `javac` with classpath management, providing a more reliable build process.

### 2. Responsive Design Complexity
**Challenge**: Creating a truly responsive layout that works across all device sizes while maintaining usability.

**Solution**: Implemented a mobile-first approach with four distinct breakpoints and comprehensive CSS media queries.

### 3. JavaScript Event Management
**Challenge**: Managing complex interactions between search, filter, sort, and pagination features.

**Solution**: Created a centralized event handling system with proper state management and method coordination.

### 4. Form Validation UX
**Challenge**: Providing real-time validation feedback without being intrusive.

**Solution**: Implemented progressive validation with visual states and helpful error messages that appear contextually.
